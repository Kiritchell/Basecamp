I was messing around just researching some things I didn't understand or had caused me problems in my other projects and I had an idea for a little mini coding project. And that's how this lil site was born. I wanted to make a button that would give a random hello greeting from various languages. I am very proud of the work I did and though it's a very simple project I'm still learning JS and not feeling strong in it yet. I am happy to brag I only had to google for help 2 times for the whole project and was able to do 90% on my own.

Enjoy!
