# Charizard

My name is Kirk and I've really been trying to learn how to code. I live in Lubbock, Texas and currently work in a different field. I have a family consisting of a wife and a precious german shepherd who loves to just play more than anything else in the world. I love running, being in nature and soliving puzzles. My goal is to be a self taught web developper and use what I learn to get a career in web developping.

This is probably a pretty lame Repository but it'll end up being almost a journal for me and my learning as well as a bit of a grab bag of things that don't really have their own home elsewhere.

# Git tips!

I had to re-set up my Github on my Mac and it was a _bit of a struggle_ at first. Apparently it's been a while since I've done Github work.

First off I used the instructions and followed everything here.

Next let's just remember a few tips!

1. In Terminal get to the desired folder where your repos will go.
2. Use $ git clone INSERT SSH ONLY HERE to sync repository wherever you are in terminal
3. Make any changes to docs or work in folder.
4. On the files you changed get them back into github by using the following.
5. $ git add INSERT EXACT FILE NAME WITH CAPS AND EXTENSION
6. $ git commit -m INSERT EXACT FILE NAME WITH CAPS AND EXTENSION
7. $ git push
8. Terminal should show some processes and finish, you can check your work with $ git status
