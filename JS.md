# JavaScript Notes

# inline comments use // and multiline use /asterisk text asterisk/

# Link to script at end of body of html document so it can load after rest of page is done.

# Variable types: string, boolean, null, undefined, number, object, array, function

# definining variables: use 'let' or 'const'

# camelNotation is the proper way of naming variable types and varibales are case sensitive.
